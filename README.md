# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using SVM (RBF Kernel)

This project uses the UCI Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset to classify tumors as benign or malignant. We applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel for optimal classification performance and visualized the results using PAC, silhouette plots, class maps, stacked mosaics, and quasi residuals.
